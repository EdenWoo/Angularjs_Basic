<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
<p>The url of this page is:</p>
<h3>{{myUrl}}</h3>
</div>

<p>This example uses the built-in $location service to get the absolute url of the page.</p>
Note that the $location service is passed in to the controller as an argument. 
In order to use the service in the controller, it must be defined as a dependency.


<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $location) {
    $scope.myUrl = $location.absUrl();
});
</script>
