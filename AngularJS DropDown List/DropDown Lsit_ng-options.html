Dropdowns made with ng-options allows the selected value to be an object, 
while dropdowns made from ng-repeat has to be a string.

When you use the ng-repeat directive to create dropdown lists, the selected value must be a string.
In this example you will have to choose between the color or the model to be your selected value.
<select>
<option ng-repeat="x in names">{{x}}</option>
</select>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.names = ["Emil", "Tobias", "Linus"];
});
</script>
